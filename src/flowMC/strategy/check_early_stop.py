    """Strategy that checks if global acceptance rate has stabilized.

    After each training loop iteration, this strategy reads the global
    acceptance rate from the buffer and compares it (relative change) against
    the previous loop. If the relative change falls below the tolerance for
    a specified number of consecutive checks, it sets ``"early_stopped": True``
    in the sampler state, which causes the Sampler to skip remaining training
    loops and jump directly to the production phase.

    The ``n_training_loops`` parameter effectively becomes the *maximum*
    number of training loops when this strategy is enabled.
